1. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a starter code repository that contains a Python module called "fresh_tomatoes.py".The file fresh_tomatoes.py contains the open_movies_page() function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase your favorite movies.
