the face of an illegal blockade to prevent menstruating-age women from 
visiting the temple, the government will regard this operation as a victory. 
But clearly, even it must be aware that covert ops such as this one are not a 
sustainable solution to the problem. The government’s dilemma and also its 
responsibility is to find a way of ensuring safe passage for all women who 
want to visit the temple while keeping the peace at the same time. Given the 
passions at play, and the cynical attempts to politically exploit them, this 
is anything but an easy task. In the short term, though and this may well 
have been its intent the government has managed to alter the narrative in the 
controversy. The decision of the temple authorities to close the sanctum 
sanctorum and perform purification rituals has invoked old and regressive 
notions of purity and pollution, of defilement and desecration. They have 
focussed attention on the role of the chief priest of leaving him open to the 
charge levelled by that his actions violated both the order and the At a 
larger level, the entry of the two women has, perhaps inevitably, recalled 
Chandrachud’s words in the majority judgment in the case. In his judgment, he 
had argued that the ban on women’s entry was a of untouchability”, and their 
exclusion was a of the right to liberty, dignity and equality”. Meanwhile, as 
passions continue to escalate, it is important for the government, the and 
also those representing the devotees to initiate a conversation and prevent 
the from being consumed in a further cycle of violence and conflict over this 
issue.
